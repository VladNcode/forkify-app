Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Parcel to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7, and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save it to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.

# Features

- Query an ingredient to receive a list of recipes containing that ingredient.
- Easily bookmark or edit the servings of the selected recipe.
- Create your own recipes and store them as user recipes.
- Remove bookmarks or delete user recipes.
- LocalStorage keeps the data when users exit the app.
